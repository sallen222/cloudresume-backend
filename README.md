# Cloud Resume Challenge Backend

Frontend hosted at: https://github.com/sallen222/cloudresume

This repo contains the backend infrastructure of my cloud resume project. 
The backend is hosted on AWS and consists of an API Gateway that targets two Lambda functions which update and retrieve items from DynamoDB.
These resources are built using Terraform for infrastructure as code and deployed using Guthub Actions.
